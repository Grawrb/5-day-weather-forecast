## Project goal
```
For this project we were tasked with building a web based "5 Day Forecast" weather application.
The application should:
  *Allow the user to search by city
  *Add the selected city to the application search history
  *Display the current weather condtions for the selected city
  *The current weather conditions should include the city name, current date, an icon representation of weather condtions,
   the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
  *Display a 5-day forecast that displays an icon representation of weather condtions,the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
  *When a city in the search history is selected, the above conditions should be presented again`
```

## User story and Acceptance Criteria

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
